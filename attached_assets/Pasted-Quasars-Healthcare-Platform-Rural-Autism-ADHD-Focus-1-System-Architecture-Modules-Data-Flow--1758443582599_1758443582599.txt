Quasars Healthcare Platform (Rural + Autism/ADHD Focus)
1) System Architecture (Modules + Data Flow)
Frontend (App)

Mobile-first PWA or Flutter app (installable, offline-friendly).

Modules:

Patient registration/login

Dashboard (records, history, appointments)

Doctor directory & booking

AI bot (chat + voice)

Pharmacy module (medicine availability)

Backend

Database (secure EHR-like): PostgreSQL (Supabase) or Firebase Firestore.

APIs:

Patient records (CRUD)

Doctor list (hospital-specific)

Appointment booking (with history)

Pharmacy stock API (connect local stores / manual updates)

AI assistant API (OpenAI or open-source LLM fine-tuned for health triage)

AI Assistant

Input: patient’s reported symptoms (via text/voice).

Process: classify severity → suggest solutions (breathing exercise, ADHD-friendly focus session, stress relief) OR recommend doctor visit.

Output: local-language text/audio.

Offline-first Behavior

Registration & records cached locally, syncs when online.

AI bot limited offline (only preloaded sessions/resources).

2) UI / User Journey Flows
Flow A: Registration → Dashboard

Language Select (with audio option).

Patient Registration: Name, age, condition type (Autism, ADHD, Other), contact.

Dashboard (Home):

Records card (see health history).

Doctors card (directory & booking).

AI bot card.

Medicines card (availability).

Flow B: Patient Records

Tap “Records” → view personal history (visits, prescriptions, appointments).

Simple timeline view (big icons + dates).

Flow C: Doctor Directory & Appointment

Doctor List Screen: show doctors by hospital with specialty, availability.

Booking: patient picks doctor + slot → confirmation.

Dashboard update: appointment history stored with status (upcoming/past).

Flow D: AI Bot

Patient taps “Ask AI”.

Chat/voice interface (large text + mic button):

AI asks symptom → patient replies.

AI checks severity & responds:

Mild: suggest self-help (exercise, ADHD session, etc.).

Severe: recommend booking doctor (with “Book Now” button).

Bot can also run guided sessions (like Quasars had earlier).

Flow E: Pharmacy Stock

Tap “Medicines” → search by name OR browse categories.

List of nearby pharmacies with stock status (Green = available, Red = out).

Optional: direct call button to pharmacy.

3) Design Principles (for Rural Users)

Big cards on home screen (4 main options).

Icons + text + audio narration for each action.

Offline-ready UI: clear “last synced” badge.

Minimal typing: dropdowns, icons, mic input.

Local-language support.

4) Quick Sketch (Textual UI Layout)

Home (4 cards):
[📄 Records] [👨‍⚕️ Doctors]
[🤖 AI Bot] [💊 Medicines]

Each card opens into its flow (simple navigation, single tap).
